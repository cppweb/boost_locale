/// \mainpage Boost Locale
///
/// Boost.Locale is a library that brings high quality localization facilities in C++ way.
/// It uses \c std::locale, and \c std::locale facets in order to provide localization in transparent and
/// C++ aware way to user.
/// C++ has quite a good base for localization via existing C++ locale facets: \c std::num_put, \c std::ctype, \c std::collate etc.. But
/// they are very limited and sometimes buggy by design. The support of localization varies between different
/// operating systems, compilers, standard libraries and frequently incompatible between them.
/// 
/// On the other hand, there is great, well debugged, high quality, widely used ICU library that gives all of the goodies but,
/// it has very old API that mimics Java behavior, it completely ignores STL and provides useful API only
/// for UTF-16 encoded text, ignoring other popular Unicode encodings like UTF-8 and UTF-32 and limited but still popular
/// national character sets like Latin1.
///
/// Boost.Locale provides the natural glue between C++ locales framework, iostreams and powerful ICU library providing:
/// 
/// - Correct case conversion, case folding and normalization
/// - Collation including support of 4 Unicode collation levels.
/// - Date, time, timezone and calendar manipulations, formatting and parsing including transparent support of calendars other then Gregorian.
/// - Boundary analysis for characters, words, sentences and line-breaks.
/// - Number formatting, spelling and parsing.
/// - Monetary formatting and parsing.
/// - Powerful message formatting including support plural forms, using GNU catalogs.
/// - Character set conversion.
/// - Transparent support of 8-bit character sets like Latin1.
/// - Support of \c char, \c wchar_t and C++0x \c char16_t, \c char32_t strings and streams.
